# This file allows you to add menu items to the RMB popup menu for various
# channel groups. Each line consists of four entries:
#	1. The channel group path. This can include wildcards.
#	2. The hotkey name. This should be a single unique word.
#	3. The menu item text.
#	4. The path to the script to run when the menu item is chosen.
# The script path can be specified relative to the CHGmenu file.
# When the script is run, the full path of the channel group for which the
# menu item was chosen is passed as the first argument.
#
# The first argument can also start with the keyword "Expr:". If so, the rest
# of the first argument is treated as an expression that gets evaluated when
# the menu is brought up. If the expression evaluates to the string "1", then
# the menu item will appear. The local variable $chgmenu_chgname is defined
# when executing this expression as the full path of the channel group.

# You can use "chgls $chgmenu_chgname" to find the group, or
# "chgls $chgmenu_chgname/*" to find all of its subgroups.

# The following line adds a script called "killkids.cmd" to all channel groups:
# *	killkids	"Kill All Child Groups"	./scripts/killkids.cmd
# The following adds the script "specific.cmd" to the group "group/subgroup":
# group/subgroup	specific	"Specific Command"	./specific.cmd
# The following line adds a script only to a group named "group":
# 'Expr: strcmp($chgmenu_chgname, "group") == 0' group "Group" /tmp/foo.cmd
